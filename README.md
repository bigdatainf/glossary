## A
- **Analytics**: discovery of insights in data

- **Application**: computer software that enables a computer to perform a certain task

- **Artificial Intelligence**: developing intelligence machines and software that are capable of perceiving the environment and take corresponding action when required and even learn from those actions.


## B
- **Big Data**: a massive volume of both structured and unstructured (see the **S** and **U** appendix) data that is so large that it´s difficult to process using traditional methods (software and database). Big data is related to Volume, Variety and Velocity of data (the 3 V's) which you can add 2 more: Value and Veracity ( **the 5 V's of Big Data**).


## C
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Similar to the *local/traditional* infrastructure (see the **L** appendix) but users can access to it via internet, so you can use computing resources without installing on-premises through *virtualization* (see the **V** appendix). Cloud Infrastructure divides and abstracts resources to make them accesible to users via online (for instance: storage). It´s usually refers as *public cloud* (see the **P** appendix).

- **Community Cloud**: It´s a *cloud inftastructure* (see the **C** appendix) provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises. 

## D

- **Database-as-a-Service**: a database hosted in the cloud on a pay per use basis (e.g. Amazon DynamoDB).

- **Data Ecosystem**: a collection of infrastructure, analytics, and applications used to capture and analyze data.

- **Data Mart**: a structure / access pattern specific to data warehouse environments, used to retrieve client-facing data.

## E

- **Edge Computing**: is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data. This is expected to improve response times and save bandwidth

- **Exabytes**:  approximately 1000 petabytes or 1 billion gigabytes. 

## H
- **Hybrid Cloud**: It´s a *cloud inftastructure* (see the **C** appendix) composed of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures that remain unique entities, but are bound together by estandardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g. load balancing between clouds).


## I
- **Infrastructure**: A set of processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources used to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications.

- **Information Technology (IT) Software**: A set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.

- **Internet-of-things (IoT)**: ordinary devices that are connected to the internet at any time any where via sensors.

## L
- **Local Infrastructure**: Also knonwn as Traditional Infrastructure. It´s composed of HW and SW components such as facilities, servers, networking hardware, ... However it requieres more power, physical space and money than other infrastructure types. The main use is on-premise or private.


## P
- **Platform**:  A set of libraries, services and tools used to deploy applications created using programming languages.

- **Public Cloud**: It´s a *cloud inftastructure* (see the **C** appendix) provisoned for open use by the general public. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider, which is the businesss, academic or goverment organization or some combination of themthat own, manage and operate the cloud infrastructure.

- **Private Cloud**: It´s a *cloud inftastructure* (see the **C** appendix) provisoned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.


## S

- **Semi-structured Data**: a form a structured data that does not have a formal structure like structured data. It does however have tags or other markers to enforce hierarchy of records.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: use of algorithms to find out how people feel about certain topics.

- **Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: reusable components that implement specific groups of functionalities accessible by strictly defined application programming interfaces (APIs).

- **Software-as-a-Service**: a software tool that is used of the web via a browser.

- **Structured Data**: Organized data so it's information can be automatically extracted, eg: CSV format, etc.

- **Synchronization (data)**: the process of establishing consistency among data from a source to a target data storage and vice versa and the continuous harmonization of the data over time.


## U
- **Unstructured data**: Unorganized data in a way that information can not be automatically extracted, eg: text document, photos, etc.


## V
- **Virtualization**: It connects physical servers maintained by a service provider at any or many geographical locations.
