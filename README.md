## C
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Similar to the *local/traditional* infrastructure (see the **L** appendix) but users can access to it via internet, so you can use computing resources without installing on-premises through *virtualization* (see the **V** appendix). Cloud Infrastructure divides and abstracts resources to make them accesible to users via online (for instance: storage). It´s usually refers as *public cloud* (see the **P** appendix).

- **Community Cloud**: It´s a *cloud inftastructure* (see the **C** appendix) provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises. 


## H
- **Hybrid Cloud**: It´s a *cloud inftastructure* (see the **C** appendix) composed of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures that remain unique entities, but are bound together by estandardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g. load balancing between clouds).

## I

- **Infrastructure**: A set of processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources used to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications.

- **Information Technology (IT) Software**: A set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.

## L
- **Local Infrastructure**: Also knonwn as Traditional Infrastructure. It´s composed of HW and SW components such as facilities, servers, networking hardware, ... However it requieres more power, physical space and money than other infrastructure types. The main use is on-premise or private.

## P
- **Platform**:  A set of libraries, services and tools used to deploy applications created using programming languages.

- **Public Cloud**: It´s a *cloud inftastructure* (see the **C** appendix) provisoned for open use by the general public. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider, which is the businesss, academic or goverment organization or some combination of themthat own, manage and operate the cloud infrastructure.

- **Private Cloud**: It´s a *cloud inftastructure* (see the **C** appendix) provisoned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

## V
- **Virtualization**: It connects physical servers maintained by a service provider at any or many geographical locations.
